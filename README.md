# Cancer-Data-Project
This is an in-class project from my freshamn year at Columbia that manipulates a cancer dataset
into a 20% section that trains the model and an 80% section that it tests and analyzes.
It also provides the user with a correlation heatmap between the various statistics and a
scatter matrix that describes the data from the original CSV file.
